# Cross-Domain Communication: Parent window with HTML and child iframe with React.js

Thanks to the original code from [crookse](https://github.com/crookse)

This repository provides you with the example code to enable cross-domain communication between a parent window with HTML and a child iframe with React.js.

### DEMO
https://amydinsyahira.github.io/react-parent-window-child-iframe/

***The idea of the example code is to pass URL data from the main window to the iframe window.***

You can view a working copy of cross-domain communication at [Main Window](https://github.com/amydinsyahira/react-parent-window-child-iframe/tree/main/docs). The code to the iframe is located at [IFrame Window](https://github.com/amydinsyahira/react-parent-window-child-iframe/tree/main/iframe).

To learn more about how to use the code and how to enable cross-domain communication (for this specific case), view the [crookse](https://github.com/crookse) Medium article [here](https://medium.com/@crookse/cross-domain-communication-parent-window-and-child-iframe-aaf90fcb3e26).
